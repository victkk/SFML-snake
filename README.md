## a couple of things to be imporved
1. Manage snakes and food using an object pool.
2. reimplement window resizing adaptations in a decent manner(the current one is bullshit)
3. Add more UI components (do not use current ones as reference they are generated by GPT and caused a lot of trouble in window resizing).
4. Discard the dual-layer state machine(bad habbit from verilog)
5. Develop other snake control strategies
6. use 'vertexarray' for 'snake'(this could significantly reduce computation overhead)
